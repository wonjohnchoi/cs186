1. In BufferPool, we decided to use HashMap to record mappings between PageId and Page, so we could find out whether a PageId is cached in a (nearly) constant time and could avoid fetching the same PageId twice.

2. We did not make any API change. But we made one line of code that did not follow the comment; in HeapPageId's hashCode function, the comment asked us to compute hash code as "the concatenation of the table number and the page number." But doing so resulted in a overflow error when the concatenation was bigger than Integer.MAX_VALUE. Hence, we applied modular Integer.MAX_VALUE to the concatenation.

3. We did not miss any elements except ones commented with "not necessary for project1/lab1." 

4.
Wonjohn and Jisso both worked on implementation of TupleDesc.

Wonjohn mainly worked on implementation and debugging of TupleDesc, Tuple, BufferPool, HeapFile, SeqScan.

Jisso mainly worked on implementation and debugging of Catalog, HeapPageId, RecordID, HeapPage.

We give a lot of credits to Yan, Beidi, and Yanming for releasing their test codes (see Piazza). Thanks to them, our code got more robust.

5. Wonjohn used roughly 14 hours on the project.

We didn't find anything particularly difficult or confusing.
