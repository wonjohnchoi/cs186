1. There was no special algorithms for aggregators. In IntegerAggregator, for AVG, we decided to calculate the average in the iterator(), not in mergeTuplesIntoGroup(). 
   For HeapFile.insertTuple(), we decided to change BufferPool.getPage() in order to add a new page to the file when there's no more free pages to add a tuple. So we call HeapFile.writePage() in BufferPool.getPage().

2. In HeapFile.readPage(), we decided to throw an IllegalArgumentException() whenever a page doesn't exist so that BufferPool.getPage() can catch it and fetch a new page.

3. We did not miss any elements.

4.
Wonjohn and Jisoo both worked on implementation of BufferPool.

Wonjohn mainly worked on implementation and debugging of .

Jisoo mainly worked on implementation and debugging of Aggregate, IntegerAggregator, StringAggregator, HeapPage, HeapFile.

5. Wonjohn used roughly 14 hours on the project. Jisoo used roughly 15 hours on the project.

We didn't find anything particularly difficult or confusing.
